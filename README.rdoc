Dependencies: Ruby 1.9.3, bundler

To install:
bundle install

To run:
bundle exec foreman start


To install on your server:
Edit config/deploy.rb

Run:
cap deploy:setup
cap deploy:cold (the first time)

And on the server
cd /srv/www/cuttlefish.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/current
sudo foreman export upstart /etc/init -u deploy -a cuttlefish -f Procfile.production -l /srv/www/cuttlefish.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/shared/log --root /srv/www/cuttlefish.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/current
visudo
And add the following line:
deploy  ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service
This allows the deploy user to sudo just to manage the upstart processes
